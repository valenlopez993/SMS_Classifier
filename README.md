# SMS Classifier

This project is part of the [Free Code Camp Machine Learning course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#how-neural-networks-work). The goal was to build a Recurrent Neural Network capable of distinguishing whether a SMS is a **sapm** or not, based on its content.
